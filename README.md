# Hantas

A simple responsive framework for mobile friendly development. Hantas takes its roots from [dhg/Skeleton](https://github.com/dhg/Skeleton), and builds upon the same basic principles.

## Note

We're doing some work and shuffling things around. If you'd like easy access to the individual component parts of skeleton, take a look at the `combo-bones` branch. Otherwise, you can still grab the whole build from `master` in the `dist` dir.

See the [demo page](dist/index.html) for a visual representation of Hantas classes.
